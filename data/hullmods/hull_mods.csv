Increases range of energy weapons by %s.
Decreases energy weapon damage by %s.

Bonus is %s for hybrid weapons.

Increases ammo capacity of missile weapons by %s. Reduces cargo capacity by %s.

Due to improper containment protocols, stored ordnance may “cook off” if jostled too much.

It can be adjusted to fly more offensive fightercraft with great difficulty, due to the many compromises involved when interfacing incompatible hardware.

Overstressed Phase Coils,w_w_phase_coil_ovr,0,,,,,0,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,Meatball.w_w.data.hullmods.OvrStrCoils,"Whether through insufficient support, corrosion of delicate components, or reckless redlining, the phase coils of this vessel can only manage a brief dive of about a few seconds before being forcefully ejected from P-Space - or worse.

The coils cannot handle high levels of hard flux, decreasing the threshold at which speed bottoms out by %s. For standard-design coils with no other modifications, this takes the threshold from %s to %s. In addition, calibrating the coils properly is all but impossible - peak performance time is decreased by %s, and combat readiness degradation is increased by %s.

However, the phase-time bonus has increased %s - perhaps due to the way the coils have been butchered.

This hullmod is considered a %s, but it %s.
